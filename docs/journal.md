## Day 1
- Worked: account hardened (MFA, lab-admin, budgets), Terraform built VPC + lab box with no NAT, k3s running with secrets encryption, all tools installed.
- Broke: CloudShell blocked by account verification; root keys found on PC (removed); apostrophe in SG description; file name typos.
- Threat model v1 committed (STRIDE, 3 tiers, 6 trust boundaries).

## Day 3
- Worked: Terraform on the lab box with short-lived creds; RDS Postgres 18.3 private (10.30.23.x), encrypted, TLS forced; app_user SELECT/INSERT only; password in Parameter Store.
- Proved: no internet route to 5432; sslmode=disable refused; box role reads app param but not the admin secret.
- Broke: user_data diff from a whitespace fix (fixed with trimspace); no db.t4g.micro capacity in 1a/1b (added a 1c subnet); rds.force_ssl apply_method drift; exported creds last ~15 min.
